#### By Eric Endsley

##

This is a console application, which includes 8 total tests of all backend functionality, that displays prices for orders of bread and pastries at Pierre's Bakery. The console application greets the user, states the bakery's prices, and prompts the user to enter a number of loaves of bread & pastries for their order. The application then returns the price of the order based on the following price calculation: loaves of bread cost 5 dollars each and each 3rd loaf of bread is free (buy 2 get one free), pastries cost 2 dollars each and each 3rd pastry is 1 dollar (buy 2 get 1 half off).
